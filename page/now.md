I'm a programmer trying to find his path. I graduated from the University of
Massachusetts Amherst with a B.S in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence.

I've been pursuing many topics from Machine Learning, Web Development and
Graphics programming. One day I'll go for a Masters of Computer science!

### My favorite technologies
- Python / Numpy / Conda
- C#
- Jekyll

### What else, you nerd?
I love singing and playing piano to unwind from these technical subjects.
If I need a complete reset I will go rock climbing or dancing. Let me know
if you want someone to climb with.
